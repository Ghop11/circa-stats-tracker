The Circa Sports Million Pro Football Contest Stats

Every week they release pdfs of their stats. I run a python script to get the information from them and then output to a text file. I then get that text (which is output to an array) then update the playersData.js

# What it does
- This puts the top ranking players that are on the first page of the pdf into the leader board.
- There is a search box to search the top players
- Has the game scores after games are completed

# Used:
- Vuejs
- Nodejs
- Vuex
- Python script to parse PDF
